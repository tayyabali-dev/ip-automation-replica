# Phase 2 Development Plan: Document Ingestion and Processing

## Phase Objective
Build the core document ingestion and processing capabilities that power both ADS and Office Action workflows. This phase establishes LLM-powered parsing infrastructure to extract structured data from variable document formats and stores extracted entities in MongoDB. It also implements comprehensive Office Action analysis.

## 2.1 Sprint 1: Foundational Infrastructure

*   **Goal:** Establish the core infrastructure for document handling, asynchronous processing, and data storage.
*   **Components:**
    *   `Document Upload Service`: API endpoints and GCP integration.
    *   `Celery Task Queue Infrastructure`: Setup for asynchronous background jobs.
    *   `Extraction Results Storage Layer`: Define MongoDB schemas and data access patterns.
*   **UI:**
    *   `Document Upload Interface`: Basic multi-file drag-and-drop UI.

## 2.2 Sprint 2: Core Text Extraction

*   **Goal:** Implement the fundamental text extraction capabilities for PDF documents.
*   **Components:**
    *   `PDF Text Extraction Engine`: Handles both digital and image-based PDFs using the LLM.
    *   `Cover Sheet Parser Service`: Extracts application title and inventor order.
    *   `CSV/Form Inventor Data Processor`: Processes inventor information from structured files.

---

## 2.3 Sprint 3: Cross-Validation and Declarations

*   **Goal:** Focus on data validation by comparing information from different document types.
*   **Components:**
    *   `Declaration Document Parser Service`: Extracts inventor names from declarations.
    *   `Cross-Document Name Validation Service`: Compares inventor names from cover sheets and declarations.
*   **UI:**
    *   `Prosecution Stage Selection Interface`: UI to capture workflow configuration.

## 2.4 Sprint 4: Office Action Processing - Part 1

*   **Goal:** Begin the complex task of parsing and understanding Office Action documents.
*   **Components:**
    *   `Office Action Header Extractor`: Parses metadata from headers.
    *   `Rejection Analysis Service`: Extracts rejection and objection data.
    *   `Prior Art Reference Extraction Service`: Identifies and extracts cited prior art.

---

## 2.5 Sprint 5: Office Action Processing - Part 2 & UI

*   **Goal:** Complete the Office Action processing pipeline and build the core user dashboard.
*   **Components:**
    *   `Claim Text Extraction Service`: Extracts claim text with conditional logic.
*   **UI:**
    *   `Document Processing Status Dashboard`: Real-time status display and data preview.

---

## 2.6 Sprint 6: Human-in-the-Loop and Finalization

*   **Goal:** Implement the manual review interface and conduct comprehensive testing.
*   **Components:**
    *   `Manual Correction & Re-extraction Interface`: For human-in-the-loop quality control.
*   **UI:**
    *   `Extraction Review & Correction Interface`: The UI for manual review.
*   **Other:**
    *   Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
    *   Finalize deployment preparation for 4-server architecture and staging environment.
