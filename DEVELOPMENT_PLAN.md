# Project Blueprint: Intelligent Document Processing Platform

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the development plan for the Intelligent Document Processing Platform, as detailed in the Product Requirements Document. The goal is to build a robust and scalable solution that automates the extraction of data from patent-related documents, with an initial focus on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that provides immediate value to patent paralegals.

### 1.1. Architectural Decisions

A **monolithic architecture** will be adopted for the MVP. This approach is ideal for the initial phase of the project as it simplifies development, testing, and deployment. It provides a solid foundation from which we can later evolve into a microservices-based architecture if the need arises.

### 1.2. Technology Stack

The following technology stack has been selected to ensure a high-quality, scalable, and maintainable application:

| Category      | Technology        | Version | Justification                                                                                             |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**  | Next.js           | 14.x    | A production-ready React framework that offers server-side rendering, static site generation, and a rich developer experience. |
|               | TypeScript        | 5.x     | Enhances code quality and maintainability by adding static types to JavaScript.                            |
|               | Tailwind CSS      | 3.x     | A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development.                                           |
| **Backend**   | FastAPI           | 0.110.x | A modern, high-performance Python web framework for building APIs, with automatic interactive documentation. |
|               | Python            | 3.11    | A versatile and widely-used language with a rich ecosystem of libraries for AI and data processing.        |
| **Database**  | MongoDB           | 7.x     | A flexible NoSQL database that is well-suited for storing and querying unstructured and semi-structured data. |
| **Async Tasks**| Celery            | 5.x     | A distributed task queue that enables asynchronous processing of long-running tasks like document extraction. |
|               | Redis             | 7.x     | An in-memory data store used as a message broker for Celery and for caching.                               |
| **Deployment**| 4-Server Setup    | N/A     | A distributed deployment architecture with dedicated servers for each component.                           |
| **Cloud**     | GCP Cloud Storage | N/A     | A secure and scalable object storage solution for storing uploaded documents.                              |
| **AI/ML**     | Gemini Pro        | 1.5     | A powerful large language model for advanced document parsing and data extraction.                         |

### 1.3. Module Architecture

The application will be structured into the following key modules:

*   **User Management:** Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
*   **Document Upload & Storage:** Manages the uploading, validation, and secure storage of documents in GCP Cloud Storage.
*   **Data Extraction Pipeline:** An asynchronous pipeline that uses Celery and Gemini Pro to extract structured data from documents.
*   **Dashboard & Review Interface:** A user-friendly interface for monitoring document processing status and reviewing extracted data.

## 2. Sprint-by-Sprint Plan

The development process will be organized into two-week sprints, each focused on delivering a specific set of features.

### Sprint 1: Foundation and Core Backend

*   **Goal:** Set up the project foundation and build the core backend functionalities.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a developer, I want to set up the project structure, including the frontend, backend, and database.
    *   As a user, I want to be able to register a new account and log in to the system.
    *   As a developer, I want to implement a secure document upload endpoint that stores files in GCP Cloud Storage.
    *   As a developer, I want to set up a Celery task queue for asynchronous document processing.

### Sprint 2: Data Extraction and Frontend Basics

*   **Goal:** Implement the core data extraction logic and build the basic frontend interface.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a developer, I want to create a Celery task that uses Gemini Pro to extract data from a document.
    *   As a user, I want to be able to upload a document and see its processing status on a dashboard.
    *   As a user, I want to be able to view the extracted data in a structured format.
    *   As a developer, I want to create a basic frontend layout with a document upload form and a dashboard.

### Sprint 3: Dashboard and Review Interface

*   **Goal:** Enhance the dashboard and build the manual review and correction interface.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to see real-time updates on the document processing status dashboard.
    *   As a user, I want to be able to filter and search for specific documents on the dashboard.
    *   As a user, I want to be able to review and correct low-confidence extractions.
    *   As a developer, I want to implement an endpoint for updating corrected data.

### Sprint 4: Finalization and Deployment
